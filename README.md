# School Shootings
 

I've showcased several Tableau Dashboards utilizing the data reported by The Washington Post on school shootings in America. This Tableau Workbook can be located in the "Tableau Workbooks" directory within this repository. Please feel free to explore the dashboard images provided and download any workbook that catches your attention.

My goal of this analysis is to help the community to understand the various aspects that play crucial roles in school shootings in communities. The target is to highlight the patterns in school shootings over two decades to discern the profile and methodology of these shooters. My process is dive into data from 1999 to 2023, with predictions for the next 4 years. I look at features allow us to see solutions that decrease these numbers. Communities can use this analysis to take action towards prevention and legislation.

# Recommendations Based on EDA Findings

### Understanding the Profile of Typical Shooters
Based on our analysis of typical school shooters, we can enhance our ability to address underlying issues before tragic incidents occur. To achieve this, we recommend the implementation of local programs that offer mental health support, counseling, and resources to address potential underlying concerns. Additionally, mentoring programs that connect shooters with positive role models can provide guidance and support during this critical stage. Moreover, we should develop peer support programs in which students are trained to recognize signs of distress in their peers and are equipped to report concerns to school authorities or counselors.

### Actions Around Gun Control and Legislation
Our analysis of the "Shootings By State" dataset highlights Texas and California as states with the highest number of school shootings. To address this, we propose several legislative actions and comprehensive programs:

Implement universal background checks for all gun buyers to prevent individuals with histories of violence or mental illness from acquiring firearms. Enact red flag laws that empower law enforcement and family members to petition the court for temporary firearm removal from individuals deemed a threat. Enforce safe storage laws requiring secure firearm storage, especially to prevent unauthorized access by children and adolescents. Consider gun buyback programs to reduce the number of firearms in circulation, particularly among those who no longer wish to possess them. Advocate for comprehensive state and federal legislation covering various aspects of gun violence prevention, including gun trafficking, magazine capacity limits, and assault weapon bans.

### Enhancing Mental Health Support
Given the complex nature of the increase in the age of shooters over the years, we recommend the following considerations:

**Longer Planning Periods:** Older individuals may exhibit longer planning periods before committing acts of violence. Addressing this requires early intervention and awareness.

**Intervention and Prevention:** Enhanced intervention and prevention measures can deter younger individuals from engaging in school shootings. Proactive identification of warning signs is crucial.

**Maturity and Emotional Regulation:** As individuals grow older, they may develop better emotional regulation and coping skills. Promote emotional development and coping strategies.

**Increased Awareness:** Heightened awareness of potential violence signs can result in earlier interventions, potentially preventing escalation.

**Environmental Factors:** Socioeconomic conditions and community support can influence the age of individuals involved in school shootings.

**Media and Online Influence:** Address the influence of media and online platforms, particularly on older individuals.

**Access to Weapons:** Consider stricter access controls on firearms and weapons to prevent older individuals from carrying out attacks.

### Addressing Seasonal Trends

The data reveals a seasonal trend in school shootings, with the majority of incidents occurring in the first quarter of the year. To address this, consider these actions:

**Increased Vigilance During Peak Seasons:** Heighten security measures, conduct drills, and raise awareness, particularly during the first quarter of the year.

**Mental Health Support:** Recognize the challenges associated with the winter months, including reduced daylight and holiday-related stress, and provide additional mental health support during this period.

**Targeted Awareness Campaigns:** Launch awareness campaigns at the start of the year to remind stakeholders about the importance of reporting concerns and signs of distress.

**Enhanced School-Based Programs:** Strengthen programs focusing on conflict resolution, anger management, and emotional intelligence, which are especially valuable during periods of heightened stress.

**Community Engagement:** Foster community engagement to create a supportive and vigilant environment, encouraging residents to report suspicious activity or concerns about potential threats.

By implementing these recommendations, we aim to enhance our ability to prevent school shootings, address underlying issues, and create a safer environment for students, staff, and communities.

# School Shootings
 

I've showcased several Tableau Dashboards utilizing the data reported by The Washington Post on school shootings in America. This Tableau Workbook can be located in the "Tableau Workbooks" directory within this repository. Please feel free to explore the dashboard images provided and download any workbook that catches your attention.



My goal of this analysis is to help the community to understand the various aspects that play crucial roles in school shootings in communities. The target is to highlight the patterns in school shootings over two decades to disern the profile and methodology of these shooters. My process is dive into data from 1999 to 2023, with predictions for the next 4 years. I look at features allow us to see solutions that decrease these numbers. Communities can use this analysis to take action towards prevention and legislation.
